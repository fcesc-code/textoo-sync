# TEXTOO

## Purpose

Textoo is a web application for teaching and learning languages. It is based on well established activities focused on language and aims to give them new
momentum by making dynamic activities for groups or individuals that can be both fun and educational. A specific focus is given to learning metrics and other
features that highlight focus the activity towards education rather than pure passtime gamification.

Although this code is public, it is subject to [creative commons license](https://github.com/fcesc-code/pre/blob/main/LICENSE.md). The project is also open for
contributions from July 2022.

This application is developed as the final project for the
[Web apps and sites development Master](https://estudis.uoc.edu/ca/masters-universitaris/desenvolupament-llocs-aplicacions-web/presentacio)
by [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](http://uoc.edu). \

## Public web

## How to use this code

Download or clone the repository. Then, install the dependencies using `npm install`. To start the app in development mode run `npm run dev` and open your browser on
[localhost](http://localhost:4200). For further commands, see the commands section below.

Content lives inside the `src/` folder. If you do not want to change the configuration or are unsure about what you are doing, do not edit files outside the `src/` folder.

Always run the following commands during the development stage and for production builds. Please note that it is expected that all projects built with this boilerplate are compiled using `npm run build` before they are published.

### Commands

Main commands:
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run start` | Runs NestJS in development mode. |
| `npm run start:dev` | Runs NestJS in development watch mode. |
| `npm run start:prod` | Runs NestJS in production mode. |
| `npm run clean` | Removes all build files. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint for javascript and html files, showing a report. If you are using VSCode, the extension for ESLint works too. |
| `npm run lint:ci` | Runs ESLint aud automatically fixes the warnings and errors that can be fixed. |
| `npm run test` | Runs the tests and opens jasmine in a browser, so that tests are re-run if a file is modified. Recommended option for development. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs the e2e tests once and returns an exit code. |
| `npm run test:ci` | Runs the tests once and returns an exit code, so that it can be integrated in a CI pipeline. Option for continuous integration. |
| `npm run test:cov` | Runs the tests once and generates a coverage report in lcov and html formats. Lcov is used for code scanner sonarqube. |
| `npm run ci` | Runs `lint`, `test`, `clean` and `build` scripts sequentially, this is rather to integrate in a CI process but can also be run manually. |
